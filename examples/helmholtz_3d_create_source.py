Helmholtz 3D example to demonstrate utilities.create_source
===========================================================
This example simulates the propagation of a wave through a 3D medium 
with an interface of two media with different refractive indices, and 
can be simulated with one of the three primitive sources available as 
functions in utilities.create_source: point_source, plane_wave, or 
gaussian_beam.
